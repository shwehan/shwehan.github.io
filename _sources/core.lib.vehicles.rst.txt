Vehicles package
===========================

Overview
--------
Vehicles package provides classes and methods to create vehicles of different types  and a base Vehicle class that contains all the basic functionalities of any vehicle. We adopted a factory design pattern for the creation of a vehicle wherein, the creation of every Vehicle is forced through a common factory class VehicleFactory which has a build_vehicle method. The build_vehicle method takes the vehicle config (such as vehicle type, sensors, engine) and instantiates the corresponding Vehicle object. The VehicleFactory class also has a method place_on_map which takes a start node and end node of type CATS.maps.Node and places it on the map.

We implemented different types of vehicles which inherit the base Vehicle class. As of now, we have Car, Truck, Bus and IntelligentCar. The different types of vehicles differ in their physical attributes like length, width, engine, sensors, decision modules, etc. IntelligentCar is the utopian smart car with complete autonomy, V2X communication, adherence to traffic rules etc. Developing the decision module of this type of vehicle is the main goal of this software.
