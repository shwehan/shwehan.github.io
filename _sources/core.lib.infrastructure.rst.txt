Infrastructure package
=================================

Overview
--------
Infrastructure package is used to model traffic signals, stop lights, pedestrian crossing boards. Currently, the infrastructure implemented are TrafficController and Traffic Signal. TrafficController is  an attribute of a Intersection. It coordinates switching of the signals on the traffic signals with corresponding intersection. TrafficSignal is an attribute on a Node which is controlled by a TrafficController of the Intersection which has a Node. Each lane of the road ending at the Node corresponds to the TrafficSignal on that Node.
