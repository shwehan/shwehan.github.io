Sensors package
==========================

Overview
--------
Sensors act as an interface between the environment and the vehicles' intelligence modules. This module acts as a simulation of real world sensors by taking in information from the vehicle and the maps module about the vehicle's surrounding environment. The sensors currently implemented include BasicVisual, GPS and Speed. BasicVisual provides information about the objects present in the vehicle's field of view. This can be thought of as LIDAR or RADAR readings or simply as the surroundings as seen by a vehicle driver through the windshield or the rear view mirrors. GPS provides the coordinates of the vehicle and Speed provides the speedometer reading of the vehicle. These sensor readings are used by the vehicle's internal modules to localize the vehicle and to take a decision based on the inferences. To understand the effect of sensor failures/malfunctions, these sensors can be configured to provide noisy readings to the vehicle.
